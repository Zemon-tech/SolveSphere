    description: 'Design a solar panel system that can operate efficiently in extreme temperature conditions ranging from -40째C to +60째C.',
    category: 'Engineering',
    difficulty: 3,

    detailed_description: `
## Background
Solar panels are a critical renewable energy technology, but their efficiency is significantly affected by temperature. In extreme climates, both very cold and very hot temperatures can reduce performance and durability.

## Challenge
Design a solar panel system that can:
1. Maintain at least 85% efficiency across the temperature range of -40째C to +60째C
2. Include thermal management solutions that are passive where possible to reduce energy consumption
3. Be durable enough to withstand thermal cycling (daily and seasonal temperature changes)
4. Be cost-effective and practical for implementation in remote areas

## Constraints
- The design should use commercially available materials and technologies
- The solution should require minimal maintenance
- Total system cost should be competitive with standard solar installations (within 20% premium)

## Deliverables
- Detailed system design with technical specifications
- Thermal management strategy explanation
- Performance analysis across the temperature range
- Cost estimation and comparison to standard solutions
- Implementation plan for a pilot installation
